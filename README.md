<H2>This project is no longer suppoerted.<H2>

This project was created to show power of CoronaCards on Xamarin-Android

First of all this project won't work; because you have to download license.ccdata file first from CoronaCards.com(You can get trial version for 30 days)
Secondly, you need to put downloaded license.ccdata file into corona project folder inside Assets folder. There are three sample projects.
Now you can run the project.

You can use CoronaCards feature in your own projects, therefor you have to include listed libraries to your project:
- Corona.dll
- JNLua.dll
- Network.dll
These listed above libraries can be copied from bin folder inside the project

Moreover, you have to include to your project "libs" folder from this sample project which contains ".so" libraries. Additionaly, all ".so" files' BuilAction properties should be selected as a "AndroidNativeLibrary".
